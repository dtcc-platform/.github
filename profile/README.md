DTCC Platform is an open-source platform for the exploration of
digital twins for cities. The platform is developed and maintained by
the [Digital Twin Cities Centre](https://dtcc.chalmers.se/) (DTCC)
hosted by Chalmers University of Technology. The aim is to develop an
open modelling, simulation and visualisation platform for interactive
planning, design, and exploration of cities.
